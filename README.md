# AR.Drone 2.0 optimization
Stabilization & Wall Detection APIs for the AR.Drone2.0 (Node.js)

Built for Undergraduate Project on Faculty of Engineering in Rijeka, Croatia (2016)


## Starting: 

There are two available branches, one contains stabilization solution and the second one contains solution for wall detection.
Choose the one you need and clone it.

After succesfully cloning the desired branch, follow these instructions to set up solution:

- connect to your drone's wi-fi network
- `cd` to root of project
- run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- run `node app.js` to start the server
- navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser

## Special thanks to: 
 
- **Felix 'felixge' Geisendörfer** without whose *node-dronestream* and *ar-drone* none of this would be possible
- **Jeff Brookshaw** whose *node-wARriorDrone* helped a lot in making of this project
